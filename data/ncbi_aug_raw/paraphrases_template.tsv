0	Identification of APC2 , a homologue of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor .	adenomatous polyposis coli tumour	
1	The adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumour - suppressor protein controls the Wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta ( GSK - 3beta ) , axin / conductin and betacatenin .	adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumour	
2	Complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin .		
3	In colon carcinoma cells , loss of APC leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus , where it binds to and activates the Tcf - 4 transcription factor ( reviewed in [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) .	colon carcinoma	
4	Here , we report the identification and genomic structure of APC homologues .		
5	Mammalian APC2 , which closely resembles APC in overall domain structure , was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two SAMP domains , both of which are required for binding to conductin .		
6	Like APC , APC2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin - Tcf complexes , as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in APC - / - colon carcinoma cells .	colon carcinoma	
7	Human APC2 maps to chromosome 19p13 .		
8	3 .		
9	APC and APC2 may therefore have comparable functions in development and cancer .	cancer	
10	A common MSH2 mutation in English and North American HNPCC families : origin , phenotypic expression , and sex specific differences in colorectal cancer .	HNPCC|||colorectal cancer	
11	The frequency , origin , and phenotypic expression of a germline MSH2 gene mutation previously identified in seven kindreds with hereditary non - polyposis cancer syndrome ( HNPCC ) was investigated .	hereditary non - polyposis cancer syndrome|||HNPCC	
12	The mutation ( A - - > T at nt943 + 3 ) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2 mutation so far reported .		
13	Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England , more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 ( 8 % ) English HNPCC kindreds analysed .	colorectal cancer|||HNPCC	
14	In contrast , the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 ( 50 % ) separately identified colorectal families from Newfoundland .	colorectal	
15	To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer families from England ( n = 4 ) , Newfoundland ( n = 10 ) , and the United States ( n = 3 ) , haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed .	colorectal cancer	
16	Within the English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2 splice site mutation in most families .		
17	In contrast , a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers ( CA5 and D2S288 ) in eight of the Newfoundland families .		
18	These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families .	HNPCC	
19	We calculated age related risks of all , colorectal , endometrial , and ovarian cancers in nt943 + 3 A - - > T MSH2 mutation carriers ( n = 76 ) for all patients and for men and women separately .	colorectal , endometrial , and ovarian cancers	
20	For both sexes combined , the penetrances at age 60 years for all cancers and for colorectal cancer were 0 .	cancers|||colorectal cancer	
21	86 and 0 .		
22	57 , respectively .		
23	The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher ( p < 0 . 01 ) in males than females ( 0 . 63 v 0 . 30 and 0 . 84 v 0 . 44 at ages 50 and 60 years , respectively ) .	colorectal cancer	
24	For females there was a high risk of endometrial cancer ( 0 . 5 at age 60 years ) and premenopausal ovarian cancer ( 0 . 2 at 50 years ) .	endometrial cancer|||premenopausal ovarian cancer	
25	These intersex differences in colorectal cancer risks have implications for screening programmes and for attempts to identify colorectal cancer susceptibility modifiers .	colorectal cancer|||colorectal cancer	
26	Age of onset in Huntington disease : sex specific influence of apolipoprotein E genotype and normal CAG repeat length .	Huntington disease	
27	Age of onset ( AO ) of Huntington disease ( HD ) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene .	Huntington disease|||HD|||HD	
28	Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotype , in turn , is known to influence AO in Alzheimer disease , rendering the APOE gene a likely candidate to affect AO in other neurological diseases too .	Alzheimer disease|||neurological diseases	
29	We therefore determined APOE genotype and normal CAG repeat length in the HD gene for 138 HD patients who were previously analysed with respect to CAG repeat length .	HD|||HD
